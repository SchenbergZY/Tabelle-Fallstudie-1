# 1. Difference between this repository and the origin one
  Please read Readme.md

# 2. Download data without reading Vorwort session in **Lerneinheit R - Arbeiten mit CSV-Dateien**
  Please click https://github.com/SchenbergZY/Tabelle-Fallstudie-1/raw/main/21341-0001_$F.csv to download the table to your computer. And then please upload the downloaded file to Binder or Colab you are running with.

# 3. 2 bugs which happen under Colab/Binder but not happen under Windows command line.
## 3.1 Function choose.files()
    This function has no effect running under Colab/Binder when trigger. However in Windows command line, a window will pop out to let you choose a csv file to be loaded.

## 3.2 Function edit()
    This function has no effect running under Colab/Binder when trigger. However in Windows command line, a window will pop out to let you edit the dataframe parameter on fly.
